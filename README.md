# covid-19 Data Analysis using Python
#### Coursera
This repository contains an analysis related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In this project, I worked with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each country. Also, another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. We merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
Walked through these steps:

    Importing COVID19 dataset and preparing it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.(Preprocessing)

    Deciding on and calculating a good measure for analysis.

    Merging two datasets and finding correlations among the data.

    Visualizing the analysis results using Seaborn.
    
Tools, Technologies and Skills used: Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Seaborn, Data Analysis, Statistics


It can be practised by dividing the project in the following tasks:

Task 1: Introduction -- Understand the purpose of the project, the datasets that will be used, and the question we will answer with our analysis.

Task 2: Importing COVID19 dataset -- Import COVID19 dataset and prepare it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.

Task 3: Finding a good Measure -- Decide on and calculate a good measure for our analysis.

Task 4: Importing World happiness report dataset -- Import World happiness report dataset, dropping useless columns and Merge it with COVID19 dataset to find correlations among our data.

Task 5: Visualizing the results -- Visualize our results using Seaborn.


The jupyter notebook file is well-documented. Code was written with the intent of making it self-explanatory :)

Anyone who is interested to get some practical understanding of Data Analysis can do this hands on project.
